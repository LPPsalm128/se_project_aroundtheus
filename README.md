## Project techniques

- Some of the techniques used in this projects were grid layout, BEM, Flexbox, but the most intersting part of this design is it required me to examine a already completed design and learn the specs and implemnet it into my own recreation.

## Plan on improving the project

With each project i want to become more familiar with the tools given to me and beable to handle task at a better pace with less mistakes.

It is my goal to become better at building such projects through muscle memory and pratice.
